LangY is not just a programming language; it's an ecosystem for creative expression and powerful problem-solving. Inspired by the need for simplicity without sacrificing depth, LangY brings together the elegance of high-level abstractions with the robustness of static analysis. With LangY, coding becomes an art form, and every line of code tells a story.

Features
Static Typing: LangY offers a powerful type system that ensures code correctness and clarity from the outset.
Functional Paradigm: Embrace functional programming paradigms with first-class functions, closures, and immutability.
Expressive Syntax: Designed for readability and elegance, LangY's syntax encourages clean and concise code.
Concurrency Support: Seamlessly handle concurrent tasks with built-in constructs for parallelism and synchronization.
Metaprogramming: Explore the depths of code manipulation and introspection with powerful metaprogramming features.
Extensive Standard Library: From data structures to I/O operations, LangY comes bundled with a rich standard library for diverse needs.
Modularity and Reusability: Encapsulate logic into modules and promote code reuse with ease.
Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms ensure graceful recovery from unexpected situations.
Interoperability: Seamlessly integrate with existing codebases written in other languages for maximum flexibility.

func fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

print(fibonacci(10));
